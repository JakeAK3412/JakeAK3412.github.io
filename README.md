This repository contains a (slowly growing) selection of projects and code samples that I've worked on. 

## Projects

### Gas Tax Calculator App (JavaScript/HTML/CSS)

The **Gas Tax Calculator** is a JavaScript web application that helps you calculate the taxes on gasoline purchases. It takes into account various factors 
such as fuel price, tax rates, and mileage to provide you with accurate tax calculations.

This app demonstrates my skills in JavaScript and web development. It's a simple yet useful tool that showcases my ability to create interactive and functional web applications.


### Chat Retrieval App (Python)

The **Chat Retrieval** app is a Python-based Streamlit application designed to allow
the user (usually me) to use Large Language Models (Langchain framework) to quickly
start asking questions on their own documents. 

This app is something I've used and continue to use for my research, 
some of which is published in national news media.
